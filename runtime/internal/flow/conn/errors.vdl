// These messages are constructed so as to avoid embedding a component/method name
// and are thus more suitable for inclusion in other verrors.
// This practice of omitting {1}{2} should be used throughout the flow implementations
// since all of their errors are intended to be used as arguments to higher level errors.
// TODO(suharshs,toddw): Allow skipping of {1}{2} in vdl generated errors.
