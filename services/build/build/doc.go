Command build sends commands to a Vanadium build server.

Usage:
   build <command>

The build commands are:
   build       Build vanadium Go packages
   help        Display help for commands or topics

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true
   log to standard error as well as files
 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -v23.credentials=
   directory to use for storing security credentials
 -v23.i18n-catalogue=
   18n catalogue files to load, comma separated
 -v23.namespace.root=[/(dev.v.io/role/vprod/service/mounttabled)@ns.dev.v.io:8101]
   local namespace root; can be repeated to provided multiple roots
 -v23.proxy=
   object name of proxy service to use to export services across network
   boundaries
 -v23.tcp.address=
   address to listen on
 -v23.tcp.protocol=wsh
   protocol to listen with
 -v23.vtrace.cache-size=1024
   The number of vtrace traces to store in memory.
 -v23.vtrace.collect-regexp=
   Spans and annotations that match this regular expression will trigger trace
   collection.
 -v23.vtrace.dump-on-shutdown=true
   If true, dump all stored traces on runtime shutdown.
 -v23.vtrace.sample-rate=0
   Rate (from 0.0 to 1.0) to sample vtrace traces.
 -vmodule=
   comma-separated list of globpattern=N settings for filename-filtered logging
   (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns baz or
   *az or b* but not by bar/baz or baz.go or az or b.*
 -vpath=
   comma-separated list of regexppattern=N settings for file pathname-filtered
   logging (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns
   foo/bar/baz or fo.*az or oo/ba or b.z but not by foo/bar/baz.go or fo*az

Build build - Build vanadium Go packages

Build vanadium Go packages using a remote build server. The command collects all
source code files that are not part of the Go standard library that the target
packages depend on, sends them to a build server, and receives the built
binaries.

Usage:
   build build [flags] <name> <packages>

<name> is a vanadium object name of a build server <packages> is a list of
packages to build, specified as arguments for each command. The format is
similar to the go tool.  In its simplest form each package is an import path;
e.g. "v.io/x/ref/services/build/build". A package that ends with "..." does a
wildcard match against all packages with that prefix.

The build build flags are:
 -arch=<runtime.GOARCH>
   Target architecture.  The default is the value of runtime.GOARCH.
 -os=<runtime.GOOS>
   Target operating system.  The default is the value of runtime.GOOS.

Build help - Display help for commands or topics

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

Usage:
   build help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The build help flags are:
 -style=compact
   The formatting style for help output:
      compact - Good for compact cmdline output.
      full    - Good for cmdline output, shows all global flags.
      godoc   - Good for godoc processing.
   Override the default by setting the CMDLINE_STYLE environment variable.
 -width=<terminal width>
   Format output to this target width in runes, or unlimited if width < 0.
   Defaults to the terminal width if available.  Override the default by setting
   the CMDLINE_WIDTH environment variable.
