# Test the mounttabled binary
#
# This test starts a mounttable server with the neighborhood option enabled,
# and mounts 1) the mounttable on itself as 'myself', and 2) www.google.com:80
# as 'google'.
#
# Then it verifies that <mounttable>.Glob(*) and <neighborhood>.Glob(nhname)
# return the correct result.
