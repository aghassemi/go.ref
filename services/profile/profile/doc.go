Profile help

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

Output is formatted to a target width in runes, determined by checking the
CMDLINE_WIDTH environment variable, falling back on the terminal width, falling
back on 80 chars.  By setting CMDLINE_WIDTH=x, if x > 0 the width is x, if x < 0
the width is unlimited, and if x == 0 or is unset one of the fallbacks is used.

Usage:
   profile help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The profile help flags are:
 -style=compact
   The formatting style for help output:
      compact - Good for compact cmdline output.
      full    - Good for cmdline output, shows all global flags.
      godoc   - Good for godoc processing.
   Override the default by setting the CMDLINE_STYLE environment variable.
