// Package modules provides a mechanism for running commonly used services
// as subprocesses and client functionality for accessing those services.
// Such services and functions are collectively called 'commands' and are
// registered with and executed within a context, defined by the Shell type.
// The Shell is analagous to the original UNIX shell and maintains a
// key, value store of variables that is accessible to all of the commands that
// it hosts. These variables may be referenced by the arguments passed to
// commands.
//
// Commands are added to a shell in two ways: one for a subprocess and another
// for an inprocess function.
//
// - subprocesses are added using the AddSubprocess method in the parent
//   and by the modules.RegisterChild function in the child process (typically
//   RegisterChild is called from an init function). modules.Dispatch must
//   be called in the child process to execute the subprocess 'Main' function
//   provided to RegisterChild.
// - inprocess functions are added using the AddFunction method.
//
// In all cases commands are started by invoking the Start method on the
// Shell with the name of the command to run. An instance of the Handle
// interface is returned which can be used to interact with the function
// or subprocess, and in particular to read/write data from/to it using io
// channels that follow the stdin, stdout, stderr convention.
//
// A simple protocol must be followed by all commands, namely, they
// should wait for their stdin stream to be closed before exiting. The
// caller can then coordinate with any command by writing to that stdin
// stream and reading responses from the stdout stream, and it can close
// stdin when it's ready for the command to exit using the CloseStdin method
// on the command's handle.
//
// The signature of the function that implements the command is the
// same for both types of command and is defined by the Main function type.
// In particular stdin, stdout and stderr are provided as parameters, as is
// a map representation of the shell's environment.
