Actions are cohesive pieces of functionality that can be triggered from any other action in a decoupled way by just using the action name.

Please see documentation in libs/mvc/actions.js for more details about the action concept.

This folder contains modules that define functions to register and trigger application-specific actions.
These modules glue views and application services and state.
