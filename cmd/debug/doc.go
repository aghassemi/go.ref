 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -vanadium.i18n_catalogue=
   18n catalogue files to load, comma separated
 -veyron.credentials=
   directory to use for storing security credentials
 -veyron.namespace.root=[/ns.dev.v.io:8101]
   local namespace root; can be repeated to provided multiple roots
 -veyron.proxy=
   object name of proxy service to use to export services across network
   boundaries
 -veyron.tcp.address=
   address to listen on
 -veyron.tcp.protocol=wsh
   protocol to listen with
 -veyron.vtrace.cache_size=1024
   The number of vtrace traces to store in memory.
 -veyron.vtrace.collect_regexp=
   Spans and annotations that match this regular expression will trigger trace
   collection.
 -veyron.vtrace.dump_on_shutdown=true
   If true, dump all stored traces on runtime shutdown.
 -veyron.vtrace.sample_rate=0
   Rate (from 0.0 to 1.0) to sample vtrace traces.
 -vmodule=
   comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging

Debug Glob

Returns all matching entries from the namespace.

Usage:
   debug glob <pattern> ...

<pattern> is a glob pattern to match.

Debug Vtrace

Returns matching vtrace traces (or all stored traces if no ids are given).

Usage:
   debug vtrace <name> [id ...]

<name> is the name of a vtrace object. [id] is a vtrace trace id.

Debug Logs

Accesses log files

Usage:
   debug logs <command>

The debug logs commands are:
   read        Reads the content of a log file object.
   size        Returns the size of a log file object.

Debug Logs Read

Reads the content of a log file object.

Usage:
   debug logs read [flags] <name>

<name> is the name of the log file object.

The debug logs read flags are:
 -f=false
   When true, read will wait for new log entries when it reaches the end of the
   file.
 -n=-1
   The number of log entries to read.
 -o=0
   The position, in bytes, from which to start reading the log file.
 -v=false
   When true, read will be more verbose.

Debug Logs Size

Returns the size of a log file object.

Usage:
   debug logs size <name>

<name> is the name of the log file object.

Debug Stats

Accesses stats

Usage:
   debug stats <command>

The debug stats commands are:
   read        Returns the value of stats objects.
   watch       Returns a stream of all matching entries and their values as they
               change.

Debug Stats Read

Returns the value of stats objects.

Usage:
   debug stats read [flags] <name> ...

<name> is the name of a stats object, or a glob pattern to match against stats
object names.

The debug stats read flags are:
 -raw=false
   When true, the command will display the raw value of the object.
 -type=false
   When true, the type of the values will be displayed.

Debug Stats Watch

Returns a stream of all matching entries and their values as they change.

Usage:
   debug stats watch [flags] <pattern> ...

<pattern> is a glob pattern to match.

The debug stats watch flags are:
 -raw=false
   When true, the command will display the raw value of the object.
 -type=false
   When true, the type of the values will be displayed.

Debug Pprof

Accesses profiling data

Usage:
   debug pprof <command>

The debug pprof commands are:
   run         Runs the pprof tool.
   proxy       Runs an http proxy to a pprof object.

Debug Pprof Run

Runs the pprof tool.

Usage:
   debug pprof run [flags] <name> <profile> [passthru args] ...

<name> is the name of the pprof object. <profile> the name of the profile to
use.

All the [passthru args] are passed to the pprof tool directly, e.g.

$ debug pprof run a/b/c heap --text $ debug pprof run a/b/c profile -gv

The debug pprof run flags are:
 -pprofcmd=v23 go tool pprof
   The pprof command to use.

Debug Pprof Proxy

Runs an http proxy to a pprof object.

Usage:
   debug pprof proxy <name>

<name> is the name of the pprof object.

Debug Help

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

The output is formatted to a target width in runes.  The target width is
determined by checking the environment variable CMDLINE_WIDTH, falling back on
the terminal width from the OS, falling back on 80 chars.  By setting
CMDLINE_WIDTH=x, if x > 0 the width is x, if x < 0 the width is unlimited, and
if x == 0 or is unset one of the fallbacks is used.

Usage:
   debug help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The debug help flags are:
 -style=default
   The formatting style for help output, either "default" or "godoc".
