Usage:
   device acl set [flags] <device manager name>  (<blessing> [!]<tag>(,[!]<tag>)*

<device manager name> can be a Vanadium name for a device manager, application
installation or instance.

<blessing> is a blessing pattern. If the same pattern is repeated multiple times
in the command, then the only the last occurrence will be honored.

<tag> is a subset of defined access types ("Admin", "Read", "Write" etc.). If
the access right is prefixed with a '!' then <blessing> is added to the NotIn
list for that right. Using "^" as a "tag" causes all occurrences of <blessing>
in the current AccessList to be cleared.

Examples: set root/self ^ will remove "root/self" from the In and NotIn lists
for all access rights.

set root/self Read,!Write will add "root/self" to the In list for Read access
and the NotIn list for Write access (and remove "root/self" from both the In and
NotIn lists of all other access rights)

The device acl set flags are:
 -f=false
   Instead of making the AccessLists additive, do a complete replacement based
   on the specified settings.

Device Publish

Publishes the given application(s) to the binary and application servers. The
binaries should be in $VANADIUM_ROOT/release/go/bin/[<GOOS>_<GOARCH>]. The
binary is published as <binserv>/<binary name>/<GOOS>-<GOARCH>/<TIMESTAMP>. The
application envelope is published as <appserv>/<binary name>/0. Optionally, adds
blessing patterns to the Read and Resolve AccessLists.

Usage:
   device publish [flags] <binary name> ...

The device publish flags are:
 -appserv=applications
   Name of application service.
 -binserv=binaries
   Name of binary service.
 -goarch=${GOARCH}
   GOARCH for application.
 -goos=${GOOS}
   GOOS for application.
 -readers=dev.v.io
   If non-empty, comma-separated blessing patterns to add to Read and Resolve
   AccessList.

Device Help

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

The output is formatted to a target width in runes.  The target width is
determined by checking the environment variable CMDLINE_WIDTH, falling back on
the terminal width from the OS, falling back on 80 chars.  By setting
CMDLINE_WIDTH=x, if x > 0 the width is x, if x < 0 the width is unlimited, and
if x == 0 or is unset one of the fallbacks is used.

Usage:
   device help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The device help flags are:
 -style=default
   The formatting style for help output, either "default" or "godoc".
