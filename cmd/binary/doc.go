Usage:
   binary <command>

The binary commands are:
   delete      Delete a binary
   download    Download a binary
   upload      Upload a binary or directory archive
   url         Fetch a download URL

 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608

Binary Delete

Delete connects to the binary repository and deletes the specified binary

Usage:
   binary delete <von>

<von> is the vanadium object name of the binary to delete

Binary Download

Download connects to the binary repository, downloads the specified binary, and
writes it to a file.

Usage:
   binary download <von> <filename>

<von> is the vanadium object name of the binary to download <filename> is the
name of the file where the binary will be written

Binary Upload

Upload connects to the binary repository and uploads the binary of the specified
file or archive of the specified directory. When successful, it writes the name
of the new binary to stdout.

Usage:
   binary upload <von> <filename>

<von> is the vanadium object name of the binary to upload <filename> is the name
of the file or directory to upload

Binary Url

Connect to the binary repository and fetch the download URL for the given
vanadium object name.

Usage:
   binary url <von>

<von> is the vanadium object name of the binary repository

Binary Help

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

The output is formatted to a target width in runes.  The target width is
determined by checking the environment variable CMDLINE_WIDTH, falling back on
the terminal width from the OS, falling back on 80 chars.  By setting
CMDLINE_WIDTH=x, if x > 0 the width is x, if x < 0 the width is unlimited, and
if x == 0 or is unset one of the fallbacks is used.

Usage:
   binary help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The binary help flags are:
 -style=default
   The formatting style for help output, either "default" or "godoc".
