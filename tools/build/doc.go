The build tool tool facilitates interaction with the veyron build server.

Usage:
   build <command>

The build commands are:
   build       Build veyron Go packages
   help        Display help for commands or topics
Run "build help [command]" for command usage.

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true
   log to standard error as well as files
 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -vanadium.i18n_catalogue=
   18n catalogue files to load, comma separated
 -veyron.credentials=
   directory to use for storing security credentials
 -veyron.namespace.root=[/ns.dev.v.io:8101]
   local namespace root; can be repeated to provided multiple roots
 -veyron.vtrace.cache_size=1024
   The number of vtrace traces to store in memory.
 -veyron.vtrace.collect_regexp=
   Spans and annotations that match this regular expression will trigger trace
   collection.
 -veyron.vtrace.dump_on_shutdown=true
   If true, dump all stored traces on runtime shutdown.
 -veyron.vtrace.sample_rate=0
   Rate (from 0.0 to 1.0) to sample vtrace traces.
 -vmodule=
   comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging

Build Build

Build veyron Go packages using a remote build server. The command collects all
source code files that are not part of the Go standard library that the target
packages depend on, sends them to a build server, and receives the built
binaries.

Usage:
   build build [flags] <name> <packages>

<name> is a veyron object name of a build server <packages> is a list of
packages to build, specified as arguments for each command. The format is
similar to the go tool.  In its simplest form each package is an import path;
e.g. "veyron/tools/build". A package that ends with "..." does a wildcard match
against all packages with that prefix.

The build build flags are:
 -arch=amd64
   Target architecture.
 -os=darwin
   Target operating system.

Build Help

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

The output is formatted to a target width in runes.  The target width is
determined by checking the environment variable CMDLINE_WIDTH, falling back on
the terminal width from the OS, falling back on 80 chars.  By setting
CMDLINE_WIDTH=x, if x > 0 the width is x, if x < 0 the width is unlimited, and
if x == 0 or is unset one of the fallbacks is used.

Usage:
   build help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The build help flags are:
 -style=text
   The formatting style for help output, either "text" or "godoc".
