Profile Help

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

The output is formatted to a target width in runes.  The target width is
determined by checking the environment variable CMDLINE_WIDTH, falling back on
the terminal width from the OS, falling back on 80 chars.  By setting
CMDLINE_WIDTH=x, if x > 0 the width is x, if x < 0 the width is unlimited, and
if x == 0 or is unset one of the fallbacks is used.

Usage:
   profile help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The profile help flags are:
 -style=text
   The formatting style for help output, either "text" or "godoc".
